# ðŸ§  Advanced LINQ Challenges in C#

This repository contains a curated suite of LINQ exercises designed to push the boundaries of query composition, performance, and real-world applicability. Built entirely in **C#**, these challenges are ideal for developers preparing for **advanced technical interviews**, refining their **data manipulation skills**, or exploring **query optimization** in depth.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

Each challenge is crafted to explore one or more of the following LINQ concepts:

- **Joins**  
  - Inner Join  
  - Left Join  
  - Cross Join  
  - `DefaultIfEmpty()` for outer joins  
  - Group Join

- **Grouping & Aggregation**  
  - `group by` with projections  
  - Aggregations like `Sum`, `Count`, `Average`, `Min`, `Max`  
  - Nested grouping and flattening

- **Query Composition**  
  - Subqueries and nested projections  
  - Anonymous and nested types  
  - `OrderBy`, `ThenBy`, and custom sorting  
  - `Skip`, `Take`, and efficient pagination for large datasets

- **Execution Behavior**  
  - Deferred vs Immediate execution  
  - Understanding when queries are evaluated  
  - Performance benchmarking scenarios

- **Dynamic Query Building**  
  - Using `Expression<Func<T, bool>>` to build queries at runtime  
  - Composable filters and predicates

- **Data Structures in LINQ**  
  - Queues, Sets, Graphs, and hierarchical data  
  - Real-world modeling and traversal patterns

---

## ðŸ§ª Performance & Scalability

Many exercises are designed to simulate **large datasets** and test LINQâ€™s behavior under load. This includes:

- Efficient paging strategies  
- Memory-aware query composition  
- Benchmarking query execution time  
- Avoiding common pitfalls in deferred execution

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project is built for:

- Interview preparation at senior and architect levels  
- Deepening understanding of LINQ beyond surface syntax  
- Practicing query logic that mirrors real-world enterprise scenarios  
- Exploring how LINQ interacts with collections, databases, and APIs

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repo and run the challenges using your preferred .NET environment. Each challenge is self-contained and includes:

- Sample data models  
- Query logic  
- Expected outputs  
- Commentary on execution behavior and performance

## ðŸ™Œ Contributions & Extensions

Feel free to fork, extend, or contribute new challenges â€” especially if you're exploring:

- LINQ with Entity Framework  
- LINQ over NoSQL datasets  
- Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)  
- LINQ in functional programming contexts
